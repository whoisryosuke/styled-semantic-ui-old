# Styled Semantic UI Components

Design System using Styled Components and ReactJS, based on [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com_

## Development

This project primarily uses StorybookJS for development.

### Quick Start

1. `git clone` this project
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run storybook` or `npm run dev`

### Creating components

Make a new folder in the components folder, make sure the folder name is unspaced and Pascal Case (ExampleComponentName). Create a JS file with the same folder name (or appropriate variation).

Requirements

- Documented PropTypes and default props.
- Storybook examples are labeled with a `.story.js` filename.

### Project Structure

The goal is to keep the package as lightweight and minimal as possible, so there's not much to it. If you look at the `package.json`, you'll see a few dev dependencies like Babel, React, and Storybook.

In terms of actual dependencies, we only have Styled Components, since it's used in the actual components. React and react-dom are peer-deps (since the project's using this will be react-based).

#### Folder Structure

- /components/
- /components/ComponentName/
- /components/ComponentName/ComponentName.js
- /components/ComponentName/index.js - contains exports of all components in folder
- .babelrc - env and react Babel presets.

## Todo

### High Priority

- More components

### Low Priority

- Integrate Jest + Storybook for testing

### Thoughts

- Install Lerna to manage sub-packages, allowing users to install specific components (maybe separate branch?)
